Time to learn .NET!!

Tentative Plan for the weekend (the first weekend) to get started:
1)Try learning .Net in codeschool/treehouse
2)Figure out what kind of project to do with .NET
3) Go over https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/overview and try and figure that out.
4) look up other resources that will work
5) try and connect with other people in the group.
